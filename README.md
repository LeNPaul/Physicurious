# Physicurious

### About

Physicurious is a Python library for undergraduate students taking their first year-long sequence of physics courses. The library helps compute many common equations and is a useful tool for:

1. Learning (more) about computer programming through Python
2. Learning (more) about the intersection of computers and physics
3. Independently checking answers to one's homework

### Topics Covered

- 1-dimensional kinematics

### Installation

### Contact
	* For help, feature requests, bugs/errors and comments: allardbrain [at] gmail [dot] com
	* Or feel free to make edits & additions as needed and submit a pull request

### TODO

This project is still in its infancy and I will make an effort to update it monthly.

1. Finish 1D kinematics
2. Finish README
3. Documentation for 1D kinematics

### Contribute

Regardless of your skill level in Python or physics, you can help build Physicurious! Send me an email and let's talk about it.
